# Using Grafana alerts

After setting up `solana-exporter` to monitor a stakepool, it may be useful to set up Grafana alerts to notify relevant
operators of critical changes, and even automatically act to fix potential issues.

This example will use [Legacy Grafana Alerts](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/old-alerting/) instead of
Grafana 8 Alerts.

## Creating an alert

## Setting up an alert receiver on Discord

[Discord](https://discord.com/) is a VoIP, instant messaging and digital distribution platform designed for creating
communities.

1. [Add Discord as a notification channel in Grafana.](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/old-alerting/notifications/#discord)
2. Be sure to enable Discord notifications for the relevant alerts.
